3. Viewing distance note:
Use the first joint of your thumb to compare it 20 centimeters in front of your eyes. When the ball is at its maximum, it should be about the same size as the first joint of your thumb.
Or in other words, when the circle is at its maximum, you can just see it clearly.
4. Bilibili viewing notes:
We need to turn on loop playback, otherwise it will disappear immediately
Computer end: Settings in the bottom right corner - Brainwashing cycle (enabled)
Mobile end: Settings in the upper right corner - Play mode - Single episode loop (enabled)
5. Original website viewing notes:
The video was uploaded to Bilibili, but both the image quality and frame rate were reduced, making it appear less streamlined and more blurry
Go to the original website: http://penghaifu.gitee.io/ High frame rate, clear and high-quality viewing
A screen with a higher resolution looks more realistic (so sometimes it can be a good choice to look at it on a mobile phone. Although the screen is small, the resolution of a mobile phone is generally higher than that of a computer)
The higher the frame rate, the smoother the screen looks
6. PC browser notes:
Press F11 to enter full screen mode, the effect is more realistic.
Page deformation can refresh the webpage, and the PC browser can be refreshed using F5
Enabling hardware acceleration in the browser will make animations smoother (unclear Baidu)
Browsers below IE10 are currently not supported
7. Finally:
If you have any opinions or suggestions, please leave a message below
Wishing you a pleasant use and taking off your glasses as soon as possible
